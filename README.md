# Space-Sim-Prototype

Whipped up this mess back in 2020, during initial covid lockdowns.

I don't remmeber how and from where I got the code for this, but I remember following [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) and [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) on youtube for my gamedev experiments. These are most likely their codes, just 'spaghettified' and jotted together. 

Here are some screenshots.
