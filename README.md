# Space-Sim-Prototype

Whipped up this mess back in 2020, during initial covid lockdowns.
If you're here, sup, you're welcome for my absolutely messy code.

I don't remmeber how and from where I got the code for this, but I remember following Brackeys and Sebastian Lague on youtube for my gamedev experiments. These code are most likely their codes, just 'spaghettified' and jotted together. 

Here are some screenshots.
